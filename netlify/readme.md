# Netlify

This `netlify` folder is required for Netlify deployment. Netlify automatically detects and deploys serverless functions from the `netlify/functions` directory, enabling backend functionality for the application.

Without this folder structure, Netlify would not be able to properly handle serverless functions and API routes during the deployment process.
